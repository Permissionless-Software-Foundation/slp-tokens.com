# psf-slp-wallet

If you can [install node.js on your computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pbQ4ZKPBiU), you can clone the psf-slp-wallet command-line interface (CLI). This is the most comprehensive software for creating and managing tokens. I can create all types (Type 1, 65, 128) of SLP tokens, can mint them, can attach data to them, and can manage multiple wallets.

- Video and sections will be added here.
