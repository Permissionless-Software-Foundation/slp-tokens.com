SLP tokens, particularly those created with Token Tiger, offer a powerful feature: [mutable data](/data). This means the data embedded in the token can change over time, providing flexibility and dynamic content management.

## Understanding SLP Token Mutable Data

Mutable data refers to information that can be changed or updated over time. In the context of SLP tokens, this data is embedded within the token itself, allowing for dynamic updates without altering the token's core properties.

## Viewing Embedded Data

To view the embedded data in an SLP token, follow these steps:

1. Go to [slpdex.com](http://slpdex.com), a platform where you can buy and sell tokens.
2. Browse the list of NFTs for sale.
3. Click on the "Info" button for a specific token.
4. If the token has embedded data, you will see a "View User Data" button. Clicking this will open a new tab displaying the embedded blog post.

## Types of Embedded Data

The embedded data can take various forms, including:

- **Images**: Currently, a single image is supported, but future updates will include a carousel feature for multiple images.
- **Markdown Documents**: This area can be used to add rich data, such as product descriptions, terms of service, or any other relevant information.

## Managing Tokens with Token Tiger

### Accessing Token Tiger

When you log in to Token Tiger, you will see the Gallery. Navigate to Collections, where the tokens you have created are stored.

### Reference Tokens

Reference tokens are canonical examples that you can replicate to create new tokens. This feature allows you to update all your tokens from a single source.

#### Creating a Reference Token

1. Go to the Token Tiger dashboard.
2. Create a new token or select an existing one to use as a reference.
3. Edit the token's mutable data to set it up as a reference token.

#### Replicating a Reference Token

1. Navigate to the reference token in your gallery or collection.
2. Click the replicate icon to generate a new token with the same metadata.
3. The new token will have a unique token ID but will inherit all the data from the reference token.

## Editing Token Data

Token Tiger provides several editing options to manage your token's data:

### Simple Editor

- **Quick Updates**: Ideal for making minor changes, such as updating the token icon or basic metadata.
- **User Data Access**: Allows for quick edits to user-specific data.

### Blog Post Template

- **Hero Image**: Select an image to display at the top of the blog post.
- **Markdown Editor**: Add rich content using a markdown editor. This is perfect for creating detailed descriptions, product pages, or terms of service.

### Advanced Editor

- **JSON Data**: For power users familiar with JSON, this editor allows direct manipulation of the token's data structure.
- **Raw Data**: Access the raw JSON data for ultimate control, but be cautious as incorrect formatting can affect the token's display in wallets.

## Conclusion

Token Tiger provides a robust platform for managing embedded data in SLP tokens, offering flexibility and control over your token's content. Whether you're a casual user or a power user, Token Tiger has the tools to help you create and manage dynamic, data-rich tokens.
