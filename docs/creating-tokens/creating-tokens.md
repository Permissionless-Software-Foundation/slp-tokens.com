# Creating Tokens

There are a few tools available for creating tokens, depending upon your level of technical proficiency.

## Beginner

The easiest way to make a non-fungible token NFT, is with [TokenTiger.com](https://tokentiger.com). This is a simple web application for making SLP NFTs. Check out the [Token Tiger Documentation](/token-tiger-simple-nfts) page for more information.

## Advanced

If you can install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) on your computer, you can run the [psf-slp-wallet command-line interface (CLI) wallet](/fungible-with-data). This CLI app has a full suite of tools for creating all types of SLP tokens, managing minting batons, and managing different token wallets.
