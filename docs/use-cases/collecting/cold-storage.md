## 1. Understanding Cold Storage

Cold storage refers to keeping your cryptocurrency tokens offline, away from potential online threats. This method is particularly useful for valuable tokens, similar to how you might store Bitcoin. By using a physical object, such as a paper wallet, you can leverage human instincts for protecting physical items, making it a reliable method for safekeeping your tokens.

## 2. Introduction to Paper Wallets

A paper wallet is a simple and secure way to store your SLP tokens. It consists of a private key and a public address, printed on a piece of paper. This method allows you to keep your tokens offline, reducing the risk of hacking or theft.

### Key Components of a Paper Wallet

- **Public Address**: Used for receiving tokens.
- **Private Key**: Used for accessing and transferring tokens. This should never be shared or exposed.

## 3. Creating a Paper Wallet

To create a paper wallet, follow these steps:

1. Visit [OpenSourceMetalWallet.com](https://opensourcemetalwallet.com).
2. Click on the "Generate a Paper Wallet" button in the middle of the page.
3. A new tab will open and generate a new paper wallet each time you click the button.
4. Review the generated wallet, which includes a Simple Ledger address for tokens and a Bitcoin Cash address for transaction fees.
5. Print the paper wallet, ensuring the private key is hidden by folding the paper.

### Example of a Generated Paper Wallet

```
Simple Ledger Address: simpleledger:qq6pxtv8ap86cryvsg9vt9d4rslwvyc9rcucj7py9q
Bitcoin Cash Address: bitcoincash:qq6pxtv8ap86cryvsg9vt9d4rslwvyc9rcsre95ym7
Private Key: KzzRTV482YQUFKsd88Xn5opQfnGGasFguME5zG86q6fBy92coYzi
```

1. Copy the Simple Ledger address from your paper wallet.
2. Open your [SLPDEX.com](https://slpdex.com) wallet and initiate a token transfer.
3. Paste the Simple Ledger address as the recipient and complete the transaction.

## 5. Verifying Tokens on a Paper Wallet

To verify that your tokens have been successfully sent to the paper wallet:

1. Visit [explorer.tokentiger.com](http://explorer.tokentiger.com).
2. Click on the "Address" tab and paste your Bitcoin Cash address.
3. Search for the address to see if the token ID is listed.

## 6. Retrieving Tokens from a Paper Wallet

1. Ensure you have a small amount of Bitcoin Cash in your [SLPDEX.com](https://slpdex.com) wallet to cover transaction fees.
2. Navigate to the Sweep page.
3. Paste your private key and initiate the sweep process.
