# Collecting and Sharing NFTs: A Comprehensive Guide


To begin, let's assume you've already purchased an NFT from a platform like [SLPDEX.com](https://slpdex.com). Now, what's next? The first step is to understand how to display and share your newly acquired digital asset.

### Automatically Sharing on Nostr

One of the most convenient features is the automatic sharing of your NFT on your Nostr profile. When you purchase an NFT, it is instantly added to your Nostr profile, making it easy for others to see your collection. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to set this up:

1. **Create a Nostr Profile**: Go to Nostr Post and create a profile by filling out the necessary information. This will serve as your digital identity where your NFTs will be displayed.
2. **Access Your Profile**: Once your profile is set up, you can access it to see your NFTs. Your profile will include a feed similar to a Twitter feed, where your past posts and tokens in your wallet will be visible.
3. **Display Your NFTs**: By default, any NFT you purchase will be automatically added to your profile, making it a convenient way to show off your collection without any extra steps.

## Taking It to the Next Level: Curating Collections

### Why Curate Collections?

Curating collections allows you to organize your NFTs in a way that tells a story or showcases a particular theme. This is especially useful if you support multiple artists or have a specific interest in a type of digital art.

### Using Token Tiger for Sharable Collections

[Token Tiger](https://tokentiger.com) is a powerful tool for creating and managing sharable collections. Here’s how you can get started:

1. **Create an Account**: Sign up on Token Tiger to access its features.
2. **Access Collections**: Log in and navigate to the Collections area. Here, you can create new collections or manage existing ones.
3. **Create a Sharable Collection**: Click on "New Collection" and select the "Sharable" option. Give your collection a name and hit submit.
4. **Add NFTs to Your Collection**: To add NFTs, you’ll need to get the simple ledger address of your collection. Copy this address and use it to send your NFTs from your wallet. Go to the tokens area of your wallet, click send, paste the address, hit max, then the 'Send' button to transfer the token.
5. **Share Your Collection**: Once your NFTs are in the collection, you can share it with others. Click the "Share this collection" button to get a link that you can distribute. Anyone with this link can view your collection in real-time.

## Benefits of Sharable Collections

### Showcasing Support for Artists

By creating sharable collections, you can easily showcase your support for artists and content creators. This not only helps them gain visibility but also allows you to receive airdrops and gifts from the creators you support.

### Receiving Airdrops

Many content creators send airdrops and gifts to their supporters. By having a sharable collection, you ensure that you don’t miss out on these exclusive rewards. It’s a great way to engage with the community and benefit from the perks of being a supportive collector.
